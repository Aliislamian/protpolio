          "Hello, my name is Ali, and I'm a student at Islamia University right now. I'm in my sixth semester. I have a strong commond on web programming, and I am  expertise in the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

As a committed developer of the MERN stack, I have developed considerable expertise in creating cutting-edge,
 scalable online applications.
 I can effectively create and maintain databases, ensuring flawless data storage
  and retrieval, thanks to my strong MongoDB foundation.


I have experience utilising Node.js and Express.js to create server-side 
applications. As a result, I am able to develop reliable and effective APIs
 that manage the business logic and offer frictionless interaction between 
 the application's client-side and server-side components.

I'm particularly skilled with React.js, a potent JavaScript toolkit for creating user interfaces, on the front end.
